    <h2><marquee scrollamount="2" direction="up" ><center>C Language</center></marquee></h2>  
    <p>C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming,
        lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed<br>
        to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that
        map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
    </p>

   <h2><marquee scrollamount="2" direction="down" ><center>C++ Language</center></marquee></h2>
    <p>C++ is a versatile, object-oriented language that allows programmers to 
        control memory and system resources. It's a superset of the C language, and<br>
        was designed to make programming more accessible.
    </p>

    <h2><marquee scrollamount="2" direction="up" ><center>Python</center></marquee></h2>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
        Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, <br>
        make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or
        glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy-to-learn syntax <br>
        emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
    </p>
    <h2><marquee scrollamount="2" direction="down" ><center>Java</center></marquee></h2>
        <P>Java is a programming language used to create software programs and applications. It is a very powerful language
             that is used to build all kinds of software, from small programs that run<br> on your computer to large, complex
              systems that run on servers and power websites, and other online services.
        </P>
        <h2><marquee scrollamount="2" direction="up" ><center>Kotlin Language</center></marquee></h2> 
        <P>Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming.
             Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages,<br> including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. 
             Kotlin does not aim to be uniqueâ€”instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants 
             that target the JVM<br> (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).
