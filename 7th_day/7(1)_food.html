            <summary>Chicken 65</summary>
            <p>Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from Hotel Buhari,[1] Chennai,[2] India,
                 as an entrÃ©e, or quick snack. The flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies, but the 
                 exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually
                  served with an onion and lemon garnish. Vegetarian variants like "Paneer 65" or "Gobi 65" use paneer or 
                  cauliflower instead. While the name "Chicken 65" is universally used to refer to the dish, there are many
                   different theories claiming its origins. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_65" target="hii">Read more...</a></p>
